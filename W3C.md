# W3C Registries

A short list of W3C-managed value spaces that probably could be more effectively managed with a registry instead of the other models that W3C is using now.


## Under Development

* [Identifiers for WebRTC's Statistics API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc-stats/) (managed as a WD)
* [UI Events KeyboardEvent code Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-uievents-code-20161024/) and [UI Events KeyboardEvent key Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-uievents-key-20161024/) (managed as WDs)
* [Encrypted Media Extensions Stream Format Registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/eme-stream-registry/) (managed as a NOTE)
* [TTML Media Type Definition and Profile Registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml-profile-registry/) (managed as a NOTE)
* [Media Source Extensions Byte Stream Format Registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-mse-byte-stream-format-registry-20161004/) (managed as a NOTE)
* [Web App Manifest Platform Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#manifest-and-its-members) (managed [in a wiki](https://github.com/w3c/manifest/wiki/Platforms))
* [Performance Timeline Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/performance-timeline-2/) [`entryType`](https://www.w3.org/TR/performance-timeline-2/#dom-performanceentry-entrytype) (integral part of the specification)


## Stable Specifications

* [XPointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/) [Scheme Registry](https://www.w3.org/2005/04/xpointer-schemes/) (managed as Web page with a [Registry Policy](https://www.w3.org/2005/04/xpointer-policy.html))
