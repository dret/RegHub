# W3C Registries

A short list of W3C-managed value spaces that probably could be more effectively managed with a registry instead of the other models that W3C is using now.

* [Identifiers for WebRTC's Statistics API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc-stats/) (managed as a WD)
* [Encrypted Media Extensions Stream Format Registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/eme-stream-registry/) (managed as a NOTE)
* [Media Source Extensions Byte Stream Format Registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-mse-byte-stream-format-registry-20161004/) (managed as a NOTE)
* [Web App Manifest Platform Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#manifest-and-its-members) (managed [in a wiki](https://github.com/w3c/manifest/wiki/Platforms))
