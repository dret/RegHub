# RegMan

RegMan is designed to manage protocol registries in a simple GitHub-based workflow. This repository is both the repository for RegMan itself, as well as [the registry for RegMan field types. Registered RegMan field types](field-types) are fields that have a well-defined global meaning when using RegMan. RegMan allows extension fields as well, but for these, their meaning depends on the context where they are used.

For more information about what RegMan is and how to use it, please refer to the [RegMan overview](overview.md).
